# Azure ML-Ops Project Accelerator

Guided accelerator consolidating best practice patterns, IaaC and AML code artefacts to provide reference IP to a support a baseline MLOps implementation on Azure leveraging Azure ML that can be delivered in approximately 12 weeks of project scope. 

This repo is designed to be consumed 'documentation led', with the relevant IaaC or implementation code artefacts linked at the appropriate sections.
