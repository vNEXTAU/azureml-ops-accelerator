# Audit Machine Learning Workflow

Source: [Audit and manage Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-integrate-azure-policy)

When teams collaborate on Azure Machine Learning, they may face varying requirements to the configuration and organization of resources. Machine learning teams may look for flexibility in how to organize workspaces for collaboration, or size compute clusters to the requirements of their use cases. In these scenarios, it may lead to most productivity if the application team can manage their own infrastructure.

As a platform administrator, you can use policies to lay out guardrails for teams to manage their own resources. [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/) helps audit and govern resource state. Azure Policy is a governance tool that allows you to ensure that Azure resources are compliant with your policies.

Azure Machine Learning provides a set of policies that you can use for common scenarios with Azure Machine Learning. You can assign these policy definitions to your existing subscription or use them as the basis to create your own custom definitions.

For a complete list of the built-in policies for Azure Machine Learning, see [Built-in policies for Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#machine-learning).

To configure built-in policies, see [Configure built-in policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-integrate-azure-policy#configure-built-in-policies).
