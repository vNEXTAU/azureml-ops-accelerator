# Migrate Existing Machine Learning Experiment to AML

This section features an Azure Machine Learning (AML) Acceleration template which enables you to quickly onboard your existing Machine Learning code to AML. The template enables a smooth ML development process between your local machine and the Azure Cloud. Furthermore, it includes simple examples for running your model's training and batch inferecing as Machine Learning Pipelines for automation.

The usual steps of MLOps involves:
1. [Deploying Azure resources and configuring the environments of AML](1-DeployAzureResource/README.md).
2. [Preparing data for your machine learning task in AML](2-PreparingData/README.md).
3. [Build/Train and deploy machine learning model in AML](3-TrainMLModel/README.md).
4. [Inferencing/Predicting with your machine learning model in AML](4-ModelInference/README.md).
5. [Automating machine learning workflow in AML pipeline](5-AutomateMLWorkflow/README.md).
